# octane-sine

A simple student registration program with GUI that allows for quick databasing of any records to a local or remote MySQL server. Created with NetBeans IDE.

Program includes:
  -Admin Controls
  -Student record controls (Add, Delete, Find)
  -Shows real-time database fields (May not be suitable for huge # of records)
  -Login page to secure records

Need to work on:
  -Very dullllll :<, needs a splash of colour
  -Auto-update from remote addition of a record
  -Increase security (possible add 2FA)
  -Ill think of things to add as time goes on
  
Overall it is one of my first programs so give it a try!! I reccommend installing XAMPP in order to run an Apache and MySQL local server.

Pre-configured to run on root of localhost:3306 so change that accordingly.

enjoy (:D
