# octane-sine

A simple student registration program with GUI that allows for quick databasing of any records to a local or remote MySQL server. Created with NetBeans IDE.

Program includes:
Admin Controls, Student record controls (Add, Delete, Find), Shows real-time database fields (May not be suitable for huge # of records), Login page to secure records

**IMPORTANT**

Make sure to configure **src/databaseconnection.java** with your server configurations.
I have included an export of the sql database used, just create a schema called "student" and import the student.sql file

**Initial email is: test@test.com
Initial password is: test**

Change these once logged in.

enjoy (:D
